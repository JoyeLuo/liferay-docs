#Working with Plugin SDK in IDE 3.0

###Introduction

In IDE 3.0, it did some changes in Plugin SDKs including supported SDK version, running environment, workspace, SDK directory project and SDK pre-page.

1. Supported SDK Version:

	 Now SDK 6.2 and 7.0 could be used in IDE 3.0，we no longer support SDK 6.0 and 6.1 version.

2. Running Environment: JDK 8 required

3. Workspace : 

	- One eclipse workspace can only use one SDK, if you want to use another SDK, launch a new workspace.
	
	-  If you want to launch a new workspace, click File>Launch Workspace>New  Workspace.

	- If you want to copy the preferences, workbench layout and working sets setting  from original workspace, you can check the Copy Settings boxes below:

4. SDK Directory Project:

	- When you create a new Liferay Plugin(Ant) Project, you can import an SDK by clicking Next and then browser the SDK Directory.

	- And there is also another way to import SDK, go to File>Import…>Liferay>Liferay Plugins SDK Directory,  and then input the SDK Directory(the root directory of your SDK)
